/**
 * Owns the binding to the in-process `LlamaService` (and, after step 5,
 * the `:llama` process service). Provides a [state] flow consumers can
 * observe to react to connection / crash transitions.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - `bind()` is fire-and-forget; consumers `await()` for the connected
 *   state if they need a synchronous handle.
 * - `linkToDeath` will be wired in step 5 when the service moves to
 *   `:llama`. In step 3 the service runs in-process and there is no
 *   binder death to detect.
 * - The class name of the service is supplied by the caller to avoid
 *   pulling the app module into the public llamacpp package.
