/**
 * Drives the per-token generation loop on a dedicated thread.
 *
 * The native `generate(callback)` returns one token at a time. We loop
 * inside this thread until the native side stops, the client cancels,
 * or the session is destroyed. The full accumulated response from each
 * native callback is diff'd against the previously sent length so we
 * stream only the *delta* across the AIDL boundary — keeping per-token
 * IPC cost bounded by token size, not response size.
 *
 * **Lifecycle / publish race avoidance.** The Thread is created and
 * started inside `init`, then immediately blocks on [publishedLatch].
 * The publisher (currently `LlamaService.startGeneration`) MUST call
 * [publish] only after CAS-installing this worker into the session's
 * worker slot. Without that gate, a `tearDownSession` racing between
 * CAS-publish and `start()` could observe a worker whose `Thread.join()`
 * returns true immediately (Java spec: never-started thread → join
 * returns at once), free the native session, and then we'd resume
 * `nativeSession.generate()` on freed memory. The latch makes that
 * impossible: the thread is alive (blocked on the latch) until we
 * release it, so `join()` correctly waits for an exit signal.
